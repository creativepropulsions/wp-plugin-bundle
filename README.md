### Wordpress plugin bundle

A plain list of selected Wordpress plugins distilled from the [wp-most-used-plugins repo](https://github.com/webbouwer/wp-most-used-plugins).

The [list.md file](https://github.com/webbouwer/wp-plugin-bundle/blob/master/list.md) is a list of space-separated plugin-slugs (200+!) to be used [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webbouwer/wp-plugin-bundle/master/list.md) for plugin import into Wordpress using code in a theme or plugin.

Note: some plugins in list.md are specifically to be used with the commercial Divi theme for Wordpress, those can be ignored when using other WP themes. In time this repo might cover more lists of usefull plugin bundles.
